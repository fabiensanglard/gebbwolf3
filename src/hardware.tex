\section{CPU: Central Processing Unit}
  


  In 1991 there were 56 million PCs in the USA\footnote{"Computers". Collier's Encyclopedia. Vol. 7, 1992: 114, 129.}. The performance of these machines was so overwhelmingly determined by the CPU that a PC was referred to not by its brand or GPU\footnote{There was no GPU yet. The term was coined by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as "the world's first GPU", or Graphics Processing Unit.} but by the main chip inside. If a PC had an Intel 80386 or equivalent, it was called a "386". If it had an Intel 80286, it was a "286".\\
\subsection{Overview}
  The predominant CPU manufacturer was Intel with its line of x86 microprocessors\footnote{73\% of PCs sold in 1989 featured an Intel CPU according to Intel Corporation's Annual Report.}. Machines based on the 16-bit 80286 processor did not sell well but their successors with the 80386 introduced in 1985 were immensely successful\footnote{An estimated 3.74 million 386-based systems were sold in 1990 according to Dataquest in PC Magazine February 1992.}. As a result, Wolfenstein 3D was designed to run on a PC with a 386 CPU, with degraded performance (yet still playable) on a 286.\\

  \textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} A 2010 Core i7 Extreme Edition 980X 3,330 MHz operates at 147,600 MIPS.\\
  \par
 Intel built two versions of the 386: the 386-SX and the 386-DX. They were identical processors yet the DX version was almost twice as powerful as the SX (on the chart the \cw{386 SX 33MHz} and the \cw{386 DX 33MHz} are respectively at 5.1 and 8 MIPS). This is due to a data bus between the CPU and the RAM being twice as wide on the DX (32 bits vs 16 bits). The 386-SX bus unit enabled manufacturers to reuse motherboard chips designed for the Intel 286 which had a 16-bit bus unit, further reducing costs. Despite its inferiority, the SX sold well because it was cheaper and a lot of people had no idea what a "bus" was, they just wanted "a 386".\\



 \par
\textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} To help meet the demand, Intel contracted AMD to manufacture 8088, 8086 and 80286 CPUs. Lawsuits, spanning over multiple decades, ensued over the i386. The mileage varied with "clones". AMD produced the 
fastest 386 (Am386DX 40MHz). Cyrix's reputation was shaky amongst gamers due to a borderline scam 486SLC (a 386SX with 486 instructions and a small L1 cache) and a 6x86 that performed terribly under Quake.\\
\par

\subsection{The Intel 80386}
  \begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}{0.3\textwidth}
\centering
\vspace{-10pt}
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/intel_logo.pdf}
\end{wrapfigure}
The trip from blueprint to silicon was not a pleasure cruise for the 80386. It started as a side project for a small team in San Jose while select employees in Portland worked on the flagship Intel i960, a CPU using a new instruction set capable of running high level language and memory garbage collection in hardware. When the Portland team hit a wall due to performance, the 386 went from step child to king\footnote{Intel 386 Microprocessor Design and Development Oral History Panel.}.\\
\par
Two choices in the design of the 386 contributed to its success. First, the designers decided to listen to the programmers' feedback and dropped the idea of using a new instruction set. As a result the 386 is fully backward-compatible with the 286. Second, they managed to add a 32-bit operating mode which solved many of the memory addressing issues of the 286.\\
\par
Like the 80286, the 80386 used a 1.5$\mu$m process. The increased surface (from 49 mm$^2$ to 104 mm$^2$) allowed Intel to pack 275,000 transistors instead of 134,000.\\
\par
\textbf{\underline{Trivia :}}  The 286 was quite unpopular among both programmers and hardware designers. Bill Gates called it "brain dead"\footnote{Dewar, Robert B. K.; Smosna, Matthew (1990). Microprocessors: A Programmer's View.} for operating systems and Steve Morris (co-architect of the Intel 8086) called it "software poison".\\

\par Despite the apparent complexity, the 80386 can be summarized as three systems and a three-stage instruction pipeline.


\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/386_architecture.pdf}

\par
The Bus Unit is the only difference between an SX and a DX. The SX has a 16-bit bus which allowed PC manufacturers to reuse the design of the 286 motherboards and drove the price down significantly. The DX had a fully 32-bit Bus unit.
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/processing_unit.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
The three units in the execution group form a three stage pipeline: Prefetch, Decode, and Execute. The Prefetch Unit wakes up when the Execution unit is performing but not using the bus and fetches instructions in a 16-byte queue. The prefetcher is linear and cannot predict the result of a branch. As a result, a jump (\cw{JMP}) instruction triggers a flush of the entire pipeline. Instructions go down the pipeline and are decoded by the Decode Unit: the result of the decode operation is stored in a three-element FIFO where it is picked up by the Execution Unit.\\

From a programming perspective, a 386 CPU can be summarized by the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Arithmetic Logic Unit performing \cw{add}, \cw{sub}, \cw{mul} et cetera.
\item 16 registers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 32-bit General Purpose Registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
  \item 32-bit Index Registers: ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP
  \item 16-bit Segment Registers: CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, SS

  \item 32-bit Program Counter: EIP
\end{itemize}
\item A 32-bit address bus for up to 4GB of flat addressable RAM
\item Memory Paging Unit
\end{itemize}
 \par
 \textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} Despite its pipeline design, the 386 cannot do an operation in less than two cycles. Even a simple \cw{ADD reg, reg} or \cw{INC reg} takes two clocks. This is due to the absence of a SRAM on-chip cache and a slow decoding unit.\\

  \subsection{Floating Point}
  
   All that CPU power was not necessarily useful for programming a game. In order to perform trigonometric computations for 3D effects, the engine has to keep track of the fractional part of each operation. This may not appear to be an issue since the C programming language has a type (\codeword{float}) precisely for that purpose. But in practice this was a problem, and to understand it we need to understand how \codeword{float} works.\\
\par
 As David Goldberg famously wrote, \emph{"Floating-point arithmetic is considered an esoteric subject by many people"}\footnote{"What every Computer Scientist should know about Floating-Point" by David Goldberg.}. I could not agree more. Yet it is important to understand in order to fully grasp how useful it is for programming a 3D engine. In the C language, \codeword{float}s are 32-bit container following the IEEE 754 standard. Their purpose is to store and allow operations on approximation of real numbers. The 32 bits are divided in three sections:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 bit S for the sign
  \item 8 bits E for the exponent
  \item 23 bits M for the mantissa
\end{itemize} 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/floating_point_layout.pdf}
\caption{Floating Point internals}
\end{figure}
  \bigskip



\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/floating_point_math.pdf}
\caption{The three sections of a Floating Point number.}
\end{figure}
  \bigskip  


How numbers are stored and interpreted is usually explained with the formula:\\
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:fp}
\scalebox{1.5}{
$(-1)^S * 1.M * 2^{(E-127)}$
}
\end{equation*}
 \caption{How everybody hates floating point to be explained to them.}
\end{figure}
\bigskip  

Although correct, this way of explaining floating point usually leaves programmers completely clueless. I blame this dreadful notation for discouraging legions of programmers, scaring them to the point where they never looked back to understand how floating point actually works. Fortunately, there is a better way to explain it. Instead of an exponent, think of a window between two consecutive power of two integers. Instead of a mantissa, think of an offset within that window.\\ 
\par
  
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/floating_point_intuitive.pdf}
\caption{Alternate Floating Point internals.}
\end{figure}
  \bigskip  
The window tells within which two consecutive power-of-two the number will be. From [$2^{-127}$,$2^{-126}$],..., [0.5,1], [1,2], [2,4], and all the way up to [$2^{127}$,$2^{128}$]. The offset divides the window in $ 2^{23} = 8,388,608 $  buckets. With the window and the offset you can approximate a number. The window is an excellent mechanism to protect from overflowing. Once you have reached the maximum in a window (e.g. [2,4]), you can "float" it right and represent the number within the next window (e.g. [4,8]). This only costs a little bit of precision.\\


\par \bu{Trivia :} How much precision is lost when the window covers a wider range? Let's take an example with window [1,2] where the 8,388,608 offsets cover a range of 1 which gives a precision of $(2-1)/8388608=0.00000011920929$. In the window [2048,4096] the 8388608 offsets cover a range of $(4096-2048) = 2048$ which gives a precision $ (4096-2048)/8388608=0.0002$.\\
\par

The next figure illustrates how the number 6.1 would be encoded. The window must start at 4 and span to the next power of two, 8. The offset is about half way down the window.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/floating_point_window.pdf}

\caption{Value 6.1 approximated with floating point}
\label{fig:fp_internals_window6_1}
\end{figure}
  \bigskip
  
Here is a detailed example that calculates the floating point representation of a number we know well: 3.14.
\begin{itemize}
 \item The number 3.14 is positive  $\rightarrow S=0$.
 \item The number 3.14 is between the power of two 2 and 4 so the floating window must start at $2^1$  $\rightarrow E=128$ (see formula where window is $2^{(E-127)}$).
 \item Finally there are $2^{23}$ offsets available to express where 3.14 falls within the interval [2-4]. It is at $\frac{3.14 -2 }{4 - 2} = 0.57$ within the interval which makes the offset $ M = 2^{23}*0.57 = 4781507$
\end{itemize}

Which in binary translates to:

\begin{itemize}
\item S = 0 = 0b
\item E = 128 = 10000000b
\item M = 4781507 = 10010001111010111000011b
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/floating_point_layout_pi.pdf}
\caption{3.14 floating point binary representation.}
\label{fig:fp_internals}
\end{figure}
  \bigskip

The value 3.14 is therefore approximated to 3.1400001049041748046875.\\

The corresponding value with the ugly formula:

\begin{equation*}
\scalebox{1.5}{
$(-1)^0 * 1.57 * 2^{(128-127)} = 3.14$
}
\end{equation*}

\par

And finally the graphic representation with window and offset:\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/floating_point_window_pi.pdf}

\caption{3.14 window and offset.}
\label{fig:fp_internals}
\end{figure}
 

Floating point arithmetic is a powerful tool. It can represent very small or huge values while keeping track of fractional parts of a number, and also protect from overflow by floating the window when necessary.\\
\par
Floating point is handy, but the drawback is that it is also computationally expensive. The reason is simple. In order to add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers, they both have to be expressed with the same window. This means converting one number to the representation used by the other, usually with higher precision than 32 bits (typically 80 bits on Intel FPUs)\footnote{To fully grasp how much processing a FPU does, it helps to read a software implementation. I found Berkeley SoftFloat helpful.}.\\
\par
This is not a problem when everything is hardwired within a hardware floating point unit but it is a big problem for the 386. If you refer back to the architecture diagram you will notice that it only has an ALU. \emph{A 386 doesn't have a hardware Floating Point Unit}. If \cw{float} operations are found in the code, they are emulated in software by the compiler, resulting in terribly slow processing -- so slow they are not usable for anything real-time.\\ 
\par


 \textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} Since floating point operations were so slow, why did the C language end up with \cw{float} and \cw{double} types? After all, the machine used to invent the language (PDP-11) did not have a floating point unit! The manufacturer (DEC) had promised to Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson the next model would have one\footnote{The Development of the C Language by Dennis M. Ritchie.}. Being astronomy enthusiasts, they decided to add those two types to their language.\\
\par


People who really wanted a hardware floating point unit could buy one. In the '90s the only people who could possibly want one would have been scientists (as per Intel's understanding of the market). The i387 chip was marketed as a "Math CoProcessor". Performance was average and price was outrageous\footnote{\$200 in 1991 equivalent to \$374 in 2018.} but they sold extremely well.\\
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Intel 1991 ad for a "Math CoProcessor" i387.}
\label{fig:fp_internals}
\end{figure}



\par
A possible solution to the lack of a hardware floating point unit would have been to multiply an integer by 100 or 1000 to perform fractional operations and then divide to go back to integers. That is unfortunately not possible. On a 386, a multiply (\cw{imul}) instruction takes 12 to 25 cycles and a divide (\cw{div}) is even worse with 27 cycles\footnote{ZSmith.com instructions at http://zsmith.co/intel\_i.html\#imul .}.\\ 
\par
As a result, a game engine designer was stuck in an awkward situation with two half solutions to his problem. Integers which were fast but not accurate enough and Floats which were accurate but not fast enough.\\
\par
  






















\section{RAM}
The first CPUs in the Intel x86 family were designed in 1976. At a time when RAM was very expensive, the 8080 and 8086 had 16-bit registers with a 20-bit-wide address bus capable of addressing 1MiB\footnote{This book uses IEC notation where MiB is $2^{20}$ and MB is $10^6$.} of RAM. It is difficult to stress how big 1MiB of RAM was in the '70s but as an example the Apple II and the Commodore 64 both shipped with 64KiB\footnote{This book uses IEC notation where KiB is $2^{10}$ and KB is $10^3$.} which was enough to write and run amazing things. Sixteen-bit registers and a 20-bit address bus were plenty even though programming was difficult and required combining two registers to build a pointer.\\
\par
By 1986, hardware had gotten cheaper and Intel made a departure from the old architecture with its 286 and 386. These new CPUs could be put in what is called "protected mode" featuring a 24-bit-wide address bus for up to 16 MiB of flat RAM protectable with a MMU\footnote{Memory Management Unit}. The 386 also had 32-bit registers in protected mode. To make sure old programs could still run, both processors could be put in "real mode" which replicates how the Intel 8080 and 8086 operated: 16-bit registers, 20-bit address bus giving 1MiB addressable RAM with segmented addressing.\\
\par
For compatibility reasons all PCs have to start in real mode. You may assume that programmers of the '90s promptly switched the CPU to protected mode to unleash the full potential of the machines and ditch the 20-year-old real mode. Unfortunately, there was a major obstacle: the operating system MS-DOS by Microsoft Corporation.
  






  \subsection{DOS Limitations}
  Microsoft Corporation highly valued the applications running on their operating systems. As a business priority, they were adamant to never break anything with a new system\footnote{"Tales of Application Compatibility", Old New Thing by Raymond Chen.}.  Since many applications were written during the '80s on machines having only real mode, DOS 5.0\footnote{Released in June 1991.} kept running that way and as a result its routines and system calls were incompatible with protected mode. This created an awkward situation where the de-facto operating system delivered with every machine sold prevented programmers from using the machine at its full potential. Developers were forced to ignore all the features of a 1992 CPU and instead use it like a very fast Intel 8086 CPU from 1976. They were thus limited to the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item ALU
\item 16 registers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 16-bit General Purpose Registers: AX, BX, CX, DX
  \item 16-bit Index Registers: SI, DI, BP, SP
  \item 16-bit Program Counter: IP
  \item 16-bit Segment Registers: CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, SS
  \item 16-bit Status Register
\end{itemize}
\item Up to 1MiB of RAM
\end{itemize}


\bigskip

 \textbf{\underline{Trivia :}} One year earlier, in 1991, a student from the University of Helsinki started working on a hobby ("nothing big") of his: an operating system which contrary to DOS was able to use the CPU in protected mode and take advantage of the MMU and the 32-bit registers. It would become Microsoft's worst nightmare. Linus Torvalds had just started what would become Linux.



  \subsection{The Infamous Real Mode: 1MiB RAM limit}
  With protected mode unavailable, 1991 developers programmed like it was 1976: with a 20-bit-wide address bus offering only 1MiB of addressable RAM. Regardless how much memory was installed on the machine, only 1MiB could be addressed. To top it all off, addressing had to be done not with the 32-bit registers available but by combining two 16-bit registers. One was the segment, the other an offset within that segment. Hence the name: '16-bit segmented programming'.

  \bigskip
The memory layout is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item From 00000h to 003FFh : the Interrupt Vector Table.
\item From 00400h to 004FFh : BIOS data.
\item From 00500h to 005FFh : command.com+io.sys.
\item From 00600h to 9FFFFh : Usable by a program (about 620KiB in the best case). 
\item From A0000h to FFFFFh : UMA (Upper Memory Area): Reserved to BIOS ROM, video card and sound card mapped I/O.
\end{itemize}
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/real_mode.pdf}
\caption{First 1MiB of RAM layout.}
\label{fig:fp_internals}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak

Out of the original 1024KiB, only 640KiB (called Conventional Memory) was accessible to a program. 384KiB was reserved for the UMA and every single driver installed (\codeword{.SYS} and \codeword{.COM}) took away from the remaining 640KiB.

\bigskip

\textbf{\underline{Trivia :}}  In France, people had to load KEYBFR.SYS driver so AZERTY keyboard keys would be properly mapped. The driver consumed a whopping 5KiB of Conventional Memory. Needless to say French people learned pretty quickly that god mode was IDDAD\footnote{Invincibility mode in Doom is IDDQD on a qwerty keyboard but IDDAD on an azerty keyboard without the French driver loaded.}.\\
\par





\subsection{The Infamous Real Mode: 16-bit Segmented addressing}
With a 20-bit address bus and registers too small to contain a whole address (16-bit wide), Intel had to come up with an addressing system. Their solution was to combine two 16-bit registers, one designating a segment and the other an offset within that segment.\\
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/register_combination_20_bits_address.pdf}
\caption{How registers are combined to address memory.}
\label{fig:register_comb_to_20_bits}
\end{figure}
\par
There are two kinds of pointers: \cw{near} and \cw{far}. A \cw{near} pointer is 16 bits and considered \emph{fast} because it can be used as is (but it only allows a \cw{jmp} in the current code segment). A \cw{far} pointer can access anything and allows a \cw{jmp} anywhere but is slower since a 16-bit segment register has to be shifted left 4 bits and combined with the other 16-bit-offset register to form a 20-bit address.\\

That may not sound too bad, but in practice this segmented addressing leads to many issues.
The least problematic is about the language. Since C was invented on a flat memory machine, it had to be augmented by PC compiler manufacturers. That is how the \codeword{near} and \codeword{far} keywords came into existence. Macro \codeword{MK\_FP} built them and \codeword{FP\_SEG/FP\_OFF} accessed individual components. \cw{libc} is also "different": \cw{malloc} returns a \cw{near} pointer and therefore can only allocate up to 64KiB. To get more than 64KiB, \cw{farmalloc} is needed.\\
\par
The larger issue is that two pointers referring to the same address can fail an equality test. In this model, the 1MiB of RAM is divided in 65536 paragraphs by the segment pointer. A paragraph is 16 bytes but an offset can be up to 65536 bytes which results in many overlaps. This can be explained with the following examples.\\

With this system, pointer arithmetic must also receive careful consideration. A \cw{far} pointer increment only increments the offset, not the segment. If you iterate on an array larger than 64KiB you will end up wrapping around. You could use yet another type of pointer \cw{int huge*} to make pointer arithmetic work beyond 64KiB but really, nobody wants to go there.




  \subsection{Extended Memory}

The 20-bit address bus of real mode limits the addressable RAM to 1MiB. Machines of 1992 came equipped with more, typically 2MiB and even sometimes 4MiB for the most fortunate customers. This memory located beyond the addressable space is called "Extended Memory". The workaround at the time to access these resources was to install specialized drivers\footnote{See CONFIG.SYS in the Appendices.}.\\
\par
Unfortunately extended memory access was not standardized. Users could load either of the drivers provided with DOS:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) drivers: EMM386.EXE.
\item eXtended Memory Specification (XMS) drivers: HIMEM.SYS.
\end{itemize}

Or they could have no idea they had to install a driver, load nothing at startup, and not use any of the RAM beyond 1MiB. This use case was a big issue. Many customers could not understand why despite installing (extremely expensive\footnote{In 1992, 4MiB of RAM cost \$149 which adjusted to inflation would be \$256 in 2017.}) megabytes of RAM on their machine, the game they just purchased would refuse to start up claiming "Not enough memory". id Software had to publish an explanation (see Appendix "\nameref{chap:barrier640}") along with the game.\\
\par

The two APIs had similar features but completely different architecture.\\
\par
\subsubsection{XMS API}
The XMS driver works\footnote{eXtended Memory Specification (XMS) July 19, 1988.} like \cw{malloc}/\cw{free} from \cw{libc} and is the most intuitive to a programmer. It allows manipulation of data in the non-addressable extended memory via operations such as \cw{allocate}, \cw{free}, \cw{realloc}, and \cw{move}. The key aspect of XMS is that memory has to be copied between extended RAM and conventional RAM.\\
\par

\centering
\includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/expanded_ram.pdf}
\caption{Expanded/Extended memory layout}
\label{fig:ems_xms_layout}
\end{figure}





\subsubsection{EMS API}
The EMS driver opens a window beyond the addressable RAM, as shown on page \pageref{fig:ems_xms_layout}. The idea revolves around memory mapping. The driver allows for manipulating four units of 16KiB called "pages" via a 64KiB area called "Page Frame". Upon request to the driver, a page can be swapped into the page frame without copying anything.\\
\par


\subsubsection{EMS vs XMS}
How the drivers achieved the impossible (after all how do you access RAM past 1 MiB with 20-bit pointer?) and what were the trade-offs of each approach is a fascinating topic explained in detail in Appendix \ref{ems_vs_xms} on page \pageref{ems_vs_xms}.\\
\par
 If you prefer not to dive into too much detail, just remember that the EMS mapping approach was several times faster than the XMS copying approach. This speed consideration considerably impacted the memory management of Wolfenstein 3D.




\subsubsection{A system "impossible to love"}
At this point, if you are puzzled by the CPU and its design you are not alone. Over the years I came across many ways to describe this madness but three particularly stand out.\\

\par
\bu{Trivia :} 640KiB was all a game could have for executable code. But people writing compilers got clever. Strike Commander (a famous flight arcade game released in 1993) executable is 745KiB, which obviously doesn't fit in Conventional Memory. The trick is to use a technique of "overlay" pages where only a few overlays are loaded when the game starts. When the CPU is about to reach the end of an overlay, special instructions (inserted by the compiler) load the next overlays from HDD and setup a \cw{jmp} instruction for the CPU to follow. The technique can be seen as an exercise in graph paging similar to how Gromit places rails in front of an ongoing miniature train as he is sitting on top of it in "The Wrong Trousers".\\
\par

\textbf{\underline{Trivia :}}  As of 2017, more than forty five years after the introduction of the 8086, in the name of backward compatibility, all PCs in the world still start in real mode. A bootloader switches them to protected mode, loads the kernel, and then actual startup can begin.














\section{Video}

PCs were connected to CRT monitors: big, heavy, small diagonal, cathode ray-based, curved-surface screens. Most had a 14" diagonal with a 4:3 aspect ratio.\\
\par

  To give you an idea of the size and resolution, figure \ref{fig:lcd_vs_crt} shows a comparison between a 14" CRT from 1992 (capable of a resolution of 640x480) and a 30" Apple Cinema Display from 2014 (capable of a resolution of 2560x1600).\\

\par
The main issue with this system was that CRTs were analog systems while computers were digital. An interface was needed between the two and it came as a series of chipsets called "Adapters". 

  \subsection{History of Video Adapters}

The Monochrome Display Adapter (\codeword{MDA}) was released in 1981 with the IBM PC 5150. It offered two colors, allowing 80 columns by 25 lines of text.  While not great, it was standard on every PC. Many other systems followed over the years, each of them preserving backward compatibility.

Each iteration added new features and by 1991 the predominant graphic system was VGA. All video cards installed on PCs had to follow the standard set by IBM. The universality of that system was a double-edged sword. While developers had to program for only one graphic system, there was no escaping its shortcomings.\\
\par

\pagebreak





\bu{Trivia :} There was no GPU market back then. Since all video cards "only" had to be VGA compatible with 256KiB of RAM, many just bought the cheapest thing available. Note however that some cards had an 8-bit-ISA bus connector (like the Trident) and some had a 16-bit ISA connector (like the Diamond) which made them almost twice as fast.\\
\par




\subsection{VGA Architecture}

VGA can be summarized as three major systems made of input, storage, and output:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Graphic Controller and Sequence Controller controlling how VGA RAM is accessed (the CPU-VRAM interface)
\item The framebuffer (the VRAM) made of four memory banks of 64KiB (rather than one bank of 256KiB)
\item The CRT Controller and the DAC\footnote{Digital to Analog Converter.} taking care of converting the palette-indexed framebuffer to RGB and then to analog signal (VRAM-CRT interface)
\end{itemize}

The most surprising part of the architecture is obviously the framebuffer. Why have four small fragmented banks instead of one big linear one?\\
\par
Part of the explanation comes from backward compatibility. EGA, the predecessor of VGA had only 64KiB of RAM. It was very easy to design a backward compatible system that used only one bank of 64KiB.\\
\par
The more significant reason was RAM latency and the need for minimum bandwidth. A CRT running at 60Hz and displaying 640x480 in 16 colors needs a pixel every $\frac{1}{640*480*60}$th of a second. At this resolution, one pixel is encoded with 4 bits. Each nibble is translated to a 666 RGB color by the DAC. That encoding divides bandwidth by $4.5$, but still requires one byte every 108 nano-seconds.\\
\par
 Unfortunately, RAM access latency was 200ns - not nearly fast enough\footnote{Computer Graphic: Principles and Practice 2nd Edition, page 168.} to refresh the screen at 60hz, so the DAC would starve. If latency could not be reduced, the throughput could still be improved by reading from four banks at a time. Reading in parallel gave an amortized RAM latency of 200/4 = 50ns, which was fast enough.\\
\par
Keep in mind that this architecture reduced the penalty of read operations, but plotting a pixel in the framebuffer with a write operation was still slow. Writing to the VRAM as little as possible was crucial to maintaining a decent framerate.

\subsection{VGA Planar Madness}

Four memory banks grant enough throughput to reach high resolutions at 60Hz/70Hz. The price is complexity of programming, as acknowledged by even the best programmers of the time.\\
 \begin{fancyquotes}
   Right off the bat, I'd like to make one thing perfectly clear: The VGA is hard-sometimes very hard-to program for good performance.
 \bigskip \\
\textbf{Michael Abrash - Graphic Programming Black Book}
 \end{fancyquotes}
 \\
\par
The first problem with this design is that it is unintuitive. There is no linear framebuffer and figuring out which byte corresponds to which pixel on screen is difficult.\\
\par
 This type of architecture is called "planar". In mode 13h, where one pixel is encoded on one byte, to write four pixels next to each other on a line on the screen requires writing one byte in each bank. Each of these banks is mapped to the same UMA memory address. This layout is better explained with a drawing.\\

\label{fig:vga_layout_banks}
\caption{VGA mode 13h, How bank layout appears on screen.}
\end{figure}

 

\par
In order to configure this mess of planes and the controllers, 50 poorly documented internal registers must be set. Needless to say few programmers dove into the internals of the VGA.\\
\par
  Figure \ref{fig:vga_arch}, which described the architecture, was actually deceptively simplified. Figure \ref{fig:ibm_vga} shows how IBM's reference documentation explained the VGA. The maze of wire showcases well the actual complexity of the system.\\

To compensate for the complexity, IBM provided a routine to initialize all the registers via one BIOS call. One mode can be selected out of 15 available with an associated resolution, number of colors, and memory layout.

\subsection{VGA Modes}

The BIOS can be called to configure the VGA as follows.

 Programmers referenced VGA modes by their ID. It was common to see tutorials about mode \cw{12h} or mode \cw{13h}, which were the two best-suited modes for game programming.


 \subsection{VGA Programming: Memory Mapping}
To write to the VRAM, the RAM's 1MiB address space maps 64KiB starting as indicated in table \ref{vga-modes-available}. In mode \cw{13h} for example, the VRAM is mapped from 0xA0000 to 0xAFFFF. One of the first questions to come to mind is "How can I access 256KiB of RAM with only 64KiB of address space?" The answer is "bank switching" as summarized in figure \ref{ram_to_vga_mapping_label}. Write and Read operations are routed based on a mask register indicating which bank should be read or written to. \\
\par

 \subsection{VGA Programming: Mode 12h}
 The first mode commonly considered for game programming is mode \cw{12h}. It offers a resolution of 640x480 at 60hz\footnote{Because of bandwidth requirements, this mode is the only one to work at 60Hz. All others run at 70Hz.} with 16 colors. Each pixel is encoded in 4 bits (a nibble) spread across the four banks.\\
\par



\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/ram_to_vga_mapping.pdf}
  \caption{Mapping PC RAM to VGA VRAM banks.}
  \label{ram_to_vga_mapping_label}
\end{figure}
\par
 To write the color of the first pixel, a developer has to write the first bit of the nibble in plane 0, the second in plane 1, the third in plane 2 and the fourth in plane 3. The CRT Controller then reads 4 bytes at a time (one from each plane) resulting in 8 pixels on screen.\\
\par
 


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/mode12h.pdf}
\caption{VGA bank layout in mode 12h.}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak

The only good thing about this mode is that it has square pixels. The 640x480 aspect ratio matches the 4:3 of a CRT so there is no distortion of the framebuffer when it is output to the screen. Pretty much everything else is bad:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item No double buffer: 640X480/2 = 0x25800 bytes which is more than half the 256KiB (0x40000) of VRAM available.
\item High resolution means more pixels, which means more calculations and more drawing.
\item Sixteen colors severely limited artists. Games electing to use this mode usually looked worse than those using 256 color mode\footnote{The exception to the rule is "Dark Seed", an adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. Inspired by H. R. Giger artworks, it is notorious for its gorgeous visuals in 640x480, 16 colors.}.
\end{itemize}

 \pagebreak
  \subsection{VGA Programming: Mode 13h}
  Mode \cw{13h} is far more appealing since it offers a lower resolution of 320x200 with 256 colors at 70Hz. It also has the advantage of faking linear buffer. A special chip called Chain-4 uses the lower 2 bits of the RAM address to automatically program the mask and route the operation to the appropriate VRAM bank. This convenience mechanism was originally added because mode \cw{13h} was meant to display static images and a linear address space made it easy for developers to copy from RAM to VRAM.\\
  \par
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/mode_13h.pdf}
      \caption{The Chain-4 chip routes I/O between RAM and VRAM.}
      \label{not_used}
\end{figure}
\par

When writing or reading a value V at address K in RAM, the Chain-4 breaks the address down into two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item The 2 lower bits are used to configure the mask automatically. \cw{00b} goes to bank 0, \cw{01b} to bank 1, \cw{10b} to bank 2 and \cw{11b} to bank 3.
\item The 14 higher bits are right shifted by two bits and used as an offset in the bank.
\end{itemize}
  \par
  For example, writing at 0xABF13 in RAM would result in writing in bank 3 at offset 0xABF13 >> 2 = 0x2AFC4. Since this is all hardwired in the Chain-4, this extra work is fast and totally invisible to the user.
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/mode_13h_example.pdf}
      \caption{}
\end{figure}
\par
The side effect of this convenience mechanism is that 75\% of the RAM is wasted (since only 14 bits are usable for offset).\\







   \subsubsection{Setup}
  To setup the VGA in Mode \cw{13h} using the BIOS is incredibly easy. It can be done with only two instructions:\\
  \par
  \lstinputlisting[ language={[x86masm]Assembler}]{code/vga_mode13.asm}
  
  \par
  The \codeword{int 10} instruction is a software interrupt caught by the BIOS routine in charge of graphic setup. It looks up the \codeword{ax} register to setup all 50 VGA registers with the corresponding mode.\\
  \par After the VGA is initialized one can write to the mapped memory at \cw{0xA0000}. This can be demonstrated with a code sample; here is some code to clear the screen to black.\\
  
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
  \lstinputlisting[language=C]{code/clear_vga.c}
  \end{minipage}
  \label{clearvga}
  \par
  Mode \cw{13h} looks a bit better than \cw{12h} but is still pretty terrible for games or even static images:\\
  \begin{itemize}
\item With Chain-4 all the RAM address space is used and there is no way to double buffer.
\item Since the resolution is 320x200, the aspect ratio (1.6) does not match the monitor's (1.333). As a result the framebuffer stored in the VRAM is stretched when transferred to the CRT. This may seem like a small distortion but is quite problematic. An example with a circle in the framebuffer displaying as an ellipse on the screen speaks for itself.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{How the framebuffer appears once stretched on the CRT monitor.}
\end{figure}
\par





\subsection{The Importance of Double-Buffering}
Double buffering has been mentioned often while describing the hardware, but so far we have not reviewed why it is paramount to achieving smooth animation. With only one buffer the software has to work at exactly the frequency of the CRT (70Hz). Otherwise a phenomenon known as "tearing" appears. Let's take the example of an animation rendering a circle moving from the left to the right:
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/doublebuffer_before.eps}
\end{figure}
\par
In this example the CPU has finished writing the framebuffer (on the left) and the CRT's (on the right) electron beam has started to scan it onto the screen. At this point in time the electron beam has scanned half the framebuffer, so the circle has been partially drawn on the screen.
\par
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/doublebuffer_after.eps}
\end{figure}
\par
If the CPU is faster than the frequency of the CRT (70Hz), it can write the framebuffer again, before the scan is completed. This is what happened here. The next frame was drawn with the circle moved to the right. The electron beam did not know that and kept on scanning the framebuffer. The result on screen is now a composite of two frames. It looks like two frames were torn and taped back together. Hence the name "tearing".\\
\par
With two buffers (a.k.a double buffering) the CPU can start writing in the second framebuffer without messing with the framebuffer being scanned to the screen\footnote{Now the CPU speed is capped by the CRT refresh rate. Triple buffering can solve this at the price of frame latency.}. No more tearing!

 To this day, the PC speaker is the first output device to be activated during the boot process. The purpose of this primitive loudspeaker is to signal hardware problems with beep codes. It was intended to remain silent after a successful boot.\\

However, square waves are not useful for producing anything pleasant. Some people saw a potential market and companies began manufacturing what were known as "sound cards". Users could buy these separately and insert them into one of the machine's ISA slots. These cards could be connected to real audio speakers via 3.5mm jacks and tremendously improved sound capabilities. In 1991, there were four cards on the market:\\
\par
\begin{itemize}
\item AdLib music card
\item SoundBlaster 1.0
\item SoundBlaster Pro
\item Disney Sound Source
\end{itemize}
\par
Although adoption was growing (Creative would go on to sell one million SoundBlaster cards in 1991), the majority of PCs had no sound card which once again presented a huge problem for game developers.


  \subsection{AdLib}
  AdLib's music card was first on the market. The company was founded in 1988 by Martin Prevel, a former professor of music from Quebec. After an initial struggle to get game developers to use their card (the SDK was \$300), AdLib managed to convince Taito, Velocity, and Sierra On-Line to support their hardware. Sierra in particular did much to increase adoption with King's Quest IV selling close to 3 million copies. Soon after, all games supported the "music card".\\
  \par

  \end{figure}
   \par
      Equipped with a Yamaha YM3812, also known as the OPL2, the card can produce 9 channels of sound, each capable of simulating an instrument. Based on FM synthesis, the channels were limited but allowed for pleasant music.\\
\par
\bu{Trivia :} Canadian companies, and especially those from Quebec, were prevalent in the early '90s due to their technological prowess. AdLib manufactured Sound Cards, Matrox made a killing with its Millenium Graphics Card, and Watcom sold the best DOS C compiler\footnote{Watcom's compiler was so good id would use it to compile Doom.}. ATI\footnote{History would repeat itself in the late '90s in the field of graphic cards: Nvidia vs ATI.} would later emerge as a major GPU innovator in the 2000s.\\
  
  


  \subsection{Sound Blaster}
  The Sound Blaster 1.0 (code named "Killer Kard"), was released in 1989 by Creative. It was a smart product which was clearly targeting AdLib's dominant position.\\ 
\par

\begin{figure}[H] 
  \centering 
  \fullimage{hardware/sb.png} 
  \caption{A SoundBlaster (v1.2). }
  \label{asb12}
\end{figure}
\par
Not only was it equipped with the same OPL2 chip, providing 100\% compatibility with AdLib music playback, but it was also technologically superior with a DSP\footnote{An Intel MCS-51 "Digital Sound Processor", not "Digital Signal Processor".}  allowing PCM playback (digitized sounds) at 8 bits per sample and up to 22.05kHz sampling rate. The card also came with a DA-15 port allowing joystick connection. Most importantly, the SoundBlaster was \$90 cheaper than the AdLib.\\
\par
Figure \ref{asb12} is the Sound Blaster model CT1350B. Notice the OPL2 chip (labeled FM1312), the big CT1336 bus interface (labeled "CREATIVE") on the center left, the CT1351 DSP on the upper left, and the 8-bit ISA bus connector.\\
\par
  \bu{Trivia :} The numerous advantages of the Sound Blaster card over the AdLib made it the de-facto standard shortly after its release and eventually brought AdLib to bankruptcy\footnote{The reign of the Sound Blaster came to an end with Windows 95, which standardized the programming interface at application level and eliminated the importance of compatibility with Sound Blaster}.





  \subsection{Sound Blaster Pro}
The Sound Blaster Pro had all the capabilities of a Sound Blaster 1.0 but added support for stereo 22.05 kHz playback and 44.1 kHz in mono. It also added a "mixer" to blend audio sources (mic, line in, and CD) and choose the attenuation level of left and right outputs. Stereo was achieved with a pair of YM3812 chips (one for each audio channel).\\\label{sbmixerpage}

  \cfullimage{hardware/sbpro.png}{A Sound Blaster Pro card.}

Figure \ref{hardware/sbpro.png} shows a Sound Blaster Pro, model CT1330A. Most components were duplicated for stereo purposes. Notice the double FM1312 chip in the center. The two big chips in the upper left are the DSP (CT1341) and the Mixer. Below, labeled "Creative" is the big CT1316 bus interface.\\
\par
\bu{Trivia :} The card appears to have a 16-bit ISA bus connector (check the difference with the Sound Blaster 1.0). However it does not have 'fingers' for data transfer on the higher "AT" portion of the bus connector. It uses the 16-bit extension to the ISA bus to provide the user with an additional choice for an IRQ (10) and DMA (0) channel only found on the 16-bit portion of the edge connector.\\
\par
Notice on the very left of the card in black there is a Panasonic interface to connect a CD-ROM. That was the only way to connect a CD-ROM to a PC back then.


  \subsection{Disney Sound Source}
  In 1990, Disney began selling the Disney Sound Source (DSS). Plugged into the printer port (parallel port) of the PC, an 8-bit DAC similar to the "Covox Speech Thing" was connected to a speaker box. 
  \par
  \begin{figure}[H] 
    \centering 
    \scaledimage{0.8}{hardware/ss.png} 
    \caption{The speaker box (DAC not shown).}
  \end{figure}
\par
It was incredibly easy to set up, simple to program (it could only play one type of PCM and had no FM synthesizer), and very cheap compared to the other audio solutions (\$14). It would have made programmers and customers happy if not for one serious limitation. The parallel port bandwidth\footnote{The parallel port maximum bandwidth was 150 kbits/s at the time. Enhanced Parallel Port and later Enhanced Capability Port significantly increased the transfer rate necessary for scanners and laser printers.} allowed a sampling rate up to 18,750 Hz but the design of the DSS limited the PCM sampling rate to 7,000Hz. This was still enough to produce pleasant sounds, but fell short when compared to the 22kHz or even 44kHz of a Sound Blaster Pro.









\section{Bus}
Although developers had no control over them, it is still worth mentioning how these components were connected to each other.\\ 
\par

The ISA\footnote{Industry Standard Architecture.} bus connects the CPU to all devices, including RAM. It was already 10 years old in 1991 but still used universally in PCs. The data path to the RAM is either 16 bits wide for 286 and 386SX or 32 bits on 386DX based machines. It runs at the same frequency as the CPU.\\
\par

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/bus.pdf}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak
The rest of the bus connecting to everything that is not the RAM can be either:
\begin{itemize}
\item 8 bits wide at 4.77 MHz  for 19.1 Mbit/s
\item 16 bits wide at 8.33MHz for 66.7 Mbit/s\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_device\_bit\_rates .}.
\end{itemize}
It is also backward compatible and an 8-bit ISA card can be plugged into a 16-bit ISA bus.\\
\par
\vspace{10pt}
\bu{Trivia :} On ISA all devices are connected to the bus at all times and listen on the bus address lane. Each device features an "address decoder" to detect if it should reply to a bus request. This is how the VGA RAM is "mapped" in RAM. The VGA card "address decoder"  filters out everything that is not within \cw{A0000h} and \cw{AFFFFh}. Accordingly, the RAM disregards any request that is within the range [\cw{A0000h} - \cw{AFFFFh}].\\
\par
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/isa.pdf}
\end{figure}

\par
 In practice the effective bandwidth of the bus is divided by two due to packet overhead and interrupts. As a result, a PC equipped with an 8 bit ISA VGA card can push 19.1Mbits/s/2/8 = 1.1MB/s. In mode \cw{13h}, since a frame is 320x200 = 64,000 bytes, the theoretical maximum framerate with a CPU taking 0ms to render a frame is 1,100,000 / 64,000 = 17 frames per second.\\
 \par
 On a 16-bit VGA card, 33,400,000 bits per seconds gives 33,400,000/8/64000 = 65 frames per second.\\
 \par
 If you factor in other things which had to be transported by the bus such as palette, keyboard interrupt, mouse inputs, and music/sounds (at 23kHz sampling a digitized sound effect consumes 23,000/70 = 328 bytes per frame) it is easy to understand how important it was to limit data transfer and why few programs of that era could max out the VGA's 70 frames per second\footnote{Specialized demos could reach 70 fps on VGA by careful management of unchanged regions or using planar writes for the 4x speedup.}.














\section{Inputs}
At a time before the ubiquitous USB, inputs were a mess with no less than four ports, all programmed differently.\\

The parallel port (DB-25) was on every computer and usually used to connect dot-matrix printers (loud things that printed with needles). The parallel port was multi-purpose and the Disney Sound Source could be plugged into it.\\
\par
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/ports/DB-25_parallel_port.eps}
\caption{Parallel Port}
\label{fig:parallelPort}
\end{figure}


The serial port (DE9) was used to connect the mouse.
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/ports/DE9_serial_port.eps}
\caption{Serial Port}
\label{fig:serialPort}
\end{figure}

The PS/2 port was used to connect a keyboard.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.07\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/ports/MiniDIN-6_PS2.eps}
\caption{PS/2 Port}
\label{fig:ps2Port}
\end{figure}


Finally, a SoundBlaster sound card connected via the ISA bus provided a Game Port (DA-15) allowing for connection to a joystick\footnote{In 1981, the very first IBM PC could be purchased with a DA-15 "Game Port" extension card at the cost of \$55 (\$159 in 2018).}.
 \begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.19\textwidth]{imgs/drawings/ports/DA-15_GamePort.eps}
\caption{Game Port}
\label{fig:gamePort}
\end{figure}

\bu{Trivia :} The CRT monitor was connected to the VGA card via a DE15 port. More than 20 years later manufacturers are still trying to get rid of the "VGA port" as it is now commonly called. It looked a lot like a serial port and newcomers often damaged it by forcing a mouse into it.

\section{Summary}
To say a PC was difficult to program for games would be an understatement. It was a nightmare. The CPU was good at doing the wrong thing, the best graphic interface allowed neither double buffering nor square pixels, the memory model only allowed 1 standard MiB with an address composed of two separate 16-bit registers, and the \cw{near}/\cw{far} pointers forbade using standard C. Last, but not least, the default sound system could only produce square waves and the people who did have a sound card installed could have any of the three major brands.\\
\par
Yet despite all these unfavorable conditions, teams of developers gathered to tame the beast and unleash its power to gamers. One of these called themselves id Software\footnote{They originally called themselves Ideas From the Deep but then decided to shorten it to simply id, which stands for "in demand", and is pronounced as in "did" or "kid." The name also refers to id, the part of the brain that behaves by the pleasure principle in Freudian psychology.}.
