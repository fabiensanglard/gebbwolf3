\footnotetext{idTech 4 boosted with subsystems from idTech 5 such as the job system to take advantage of multi-core architecture.}
Not only did the team drive technological progress by producing new game engines, they also heavily influenced the industry by licensing their technology throughout the early '90s. A rough estimate accounts for 80 games powered by id Software's engines.\\
\par
Beyond software, id heavily influenced the graphics hardware industry. With VQuake and GLQuake offering support for 3D acceleration cards, id helped to drive sales for Rendition's Verite 1000, 3dFx's Voodoo, and later PowerVR. Doom 3 famously used OpenGL at a time where many studios succumbed to Microsoft's DirectX API.\\

id remained true to its Right Thing to Do roots and continued releasing the source code of each previous engine, helping countless programmers educate themselves with recent technology. Sadly, this practice stopped with the Rage (id Tech 5) engine.\\
