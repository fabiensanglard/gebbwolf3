# Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D
  
This is the source code for the Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein3D.
I am releasing the source code (.tex) under GPL license. I
retain ownership of all drawings and only provide them so the
overall thing is compilable.

Note: For all systems, make sure you have Inkscape version v1.0.0 or above.
If you don't, the conversion from SVG to PNG will fail.

To compile on Mac OS X:
 - Install golang: https://go.dev/
 - Install Inkscape (min v1.0.0):
    - via installer: https://inkscape.org/download/
    - or via Homebrew: `brew cask install xquartz inkscape`
 - Install MacTeX library (for epstopdf and pdflatex):
    - via installer: https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html
    - or via Homebrew, with GUI:    `brew cask install mactex`
    - or via Homebrew, without GUI: `brew cask install mactex-no-gui`
 - Make sure inkscape binary is in your PATH or symlink it where your PATH points to.      
 - Run:
    - `./make.sh`

To compile on Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives (Ubuntu):
 - Install Inkscape and TeX Live library (for epstopdf and pdflatex):
    - `sudo apt install inkscape texlive texlive-font-utils texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra golang-go`
 - Run:
    - `./make.sh`

To compile on Windows:
 - Install WSL1 or WSL2. 
 - Clone the repository inside the WSL environment. Cloning from Windows directly can cause issues due to CRLF line endings, which can prevent successful compilation.
 - Follow Linux instructions. 

To speed up compilation:
 - Build with `./make.sh debug` (uses 100 DPI assets)
 - Comment out the part you are not working on in src/book.tex
